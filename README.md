# 🗣️ IELTS Audio Recording Component

As part of my internship at **Edubot**, I developed an **interactive audio recording component** using **React** and **TypeScript** to help IELTS test takers record their speaking responses directly from the browser.



## 🎯 Project Overview

This component leverages the **MediaRecorder API** to enable real-time audio recording and playback in the browser. It’s designed to seamlessly integrate with IELTS preparation platforms, allowing users to practice and submit their speaking responses easily.



## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎙️ Start/Stop audio recording
- ▶️ Playback recorded responses
- 🔐 Error handling for microphone access permissions
- 📤 Preparation of audio data for backend submission (Flask API)
- 🔁 Integration-ready for web-based IELTS practice tests



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS
- **APIs:** MediaRecorder Web API
- **Backend (for submission):** Python Flask

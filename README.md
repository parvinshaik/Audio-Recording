As a part of my internship at Edubot, I developed an interactive audio recording component using React and TypeScript. The feature allows IELTS test takers to record their speaking responses directly from the browser using the MediaRecorder API. I implemented core functionalities such as starting/stopping audio recording, playback of recorded responses, error handling for microphone permissions, and preparing the audio data for backend submission using Flask. This assignment enhanced my skills in integrating frontend UI with real-time media APIs and backend communication.
